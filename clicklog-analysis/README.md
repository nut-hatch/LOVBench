# LOVBench Module: LOV Click Log Analysis

The R script in this module explores the search logs collected from the LOV platform and generates a PDF report using rmarkdown.

## How to use

The script LOVLogAnalysis.R was used to generate the clean log file and the HTML report. It allows insights in our pre-processing, such as removing personal identifiable information from the raw log that in rare cases was captured through the query input. 

For this reason, we do not include the raw logs required to run this script. However, the generated HTML report can be found in the results folder.
